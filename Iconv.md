## Character encoding in Finnigan files ##

There are two kinds of text encodings used in these files. All text generated by Thermo software comes encoded in UTF-16-LE. This encoding is commonly used in Windows. Communications from various instruments integrated into the system (apparently originating in their firmware) are encoded in 7-bit ASCII.

## Conversion ##
The UTF-16 encoding poses problems to most text-processing tools because of the zeroes following every base character. To read such texts without problems, use `iconv`. For example, to read the text from a method file,

```
 uf-meth sample.raw -p LTQ/Text | iconv -f utf16 -t utf8 | less
```
