This object contains a couple of double-precision floating point numbers that define the precursor ion M/z and, apparently, the enrgy with which it was whacked (both are conjectures at this point, but very plausible
ones).

It is part of ScanEvent.

  * The unknown double seems to be set to 1.0 in all observations
