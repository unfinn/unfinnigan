## Generic Data ##

Generic Data is the term Thermo uses to describe the self-decoding data. It is generic in the sense that it does not require a specific decoder to be written for each new data stream; instead, it provides a set of rules (GenericDataHeader) that can be used to configure the same decoder to read different kinds of data ([GenericRecords](GenericRecord.md)).
