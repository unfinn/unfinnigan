## Description ##

The stream contains fixed-size ScanEvent structures loaded with the detailed information about scan type (ScanEventPreamble) and containing conversion coefficients for profile-type scans. The steam begins with the record counter, although it seems to be redundant, given that there are exactly the same number of ScanEvent structures as there are [scan data packets](ScanDataPacket.md).

Thermo calls this stream a "trailer", apparently because it was added to the end of the file at one time in the history of the format. It no longer is that, as there are a couple more streams trailing it today.

## Structure ##

| Number of scan events (UInt32) |
|:-------------------------------|
| ScanEvent 1                    |
| . . .                          |
| ScanEvent _n_                  |

The pointer to the stream is contained in Run Header.
