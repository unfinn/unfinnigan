This structure encodes the output of the Fourier transform-based mass analysers and can (possibly) be used to encode the time-domain transient as well. Each scan done in the _profile mode_ generates one Profile structure; multiple scans are stored in a continuous stream of ScanDataPacket structures, in which Profile is an optional element (that is, a data packet may contain no profile -- as is the case of the _centroid-mode_ scans).

The spectra can be encoded either in the frequency domain or in the M/z domain. The scans encoded as frequency spectra are accompanied by a set of conversion coefficients (to be found in the corresponding ScanEvent and ScanParameters records, each containing a copy). These coefficients determine the transform converting the frequency values into the M/z values.

The spectra can be raw or filtered, but it they are customarily subject to severe threshold filtering (the unfiltered spectra can consume storage space at a rate of several gigabytes per minute, while the filtered ones take only a few hundred megabytes per hour). Further, the filtered spectra can be compressed by discarding the empty bins.

One single Profile format supports all these variations.

## Overall Structure ##

A typical filtered profile is compressed -- it contains only non-empty bins. Because the filtering applied to spectra in some instruments (most notably, in Orbitrap) leaves many bins empty, eliminating these bins from storage may achieve a fair degree of compression.

So a compressed spectrum can be viewed as a set of "chunks" containing the tops of the peaks (the bins whose values jumped the threshold), interspersed with zeroes. Thus, each profile chunk is a continuous range of non-empty bins. Adding two numbers to each chunk -- the index of its first bin and the number of bins it occupies -- allows to reconstruct the entire spectrum from a list of chunks. Normally, each chunk contains a single peak, suggesting that the chunks may be a product of a peak-calling routine. Some chunks may have a slightly distorted shape, perhaps due to the above-threshold noise.

This layout is common to all file versions except those made with Orbitrap, which adds one (now unknown) element to each chunk (see below)

## Example 1: LTQ-FT, FTMS ##

This example Profile is shown in the context of its parent file with the data packet header. The header and the two peaks at the start of the Profile shown here are set out with vertical space for visibility.

The following is the dump of the ScanEvent structure corresponding to scan number 1 (the second ScanEvent is, in this case, identical):

The following formula has been verified to transform the frequency spectra into the M/z values in those files having both the profiles and the centroided peaks in each scan:

> <b>Note</b>: To be precise, I was only able to verify this formula with respect to B and C, because A was either 0 or an infinitesimal number in all files I could lay my hands on.

## Example 2: LTQ Orbitrap, FTMS ##

The Orbitrap profiles are almost identical to those obtained with the [LTQ-FT](#Example_1:_LTQ-FT,_FTMS.md). The only novelty here is that every chunk in the compressed Orbitrap profiles includes a small number, whose meaning remains unknown.

As in the previous example, two leading chunks are shown in the context of their parent file.

In this case, there is a difference between the values of B, which illustrates the typical scan-to-scan variation of this parameter.

> <b>Note:</b> In one experiment, a colleague has shown that the conversion parameter B absorbs the variation caused by the run-time lock mass correction.

The following formula has been verified to transform the Orbitrap frequency spectra into the M/z values in those files having both the profiles and the centroided peaks in each scan:

> ![http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=M/z%20=%20A%20%2B%20\frac{B}{f^2}%20%2B%20\frac{C}{f^4}&nonsense=.png](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=M/z%20=%20A%20%2B%20\frac{B}{f^2}%20%2B%20\frac{C}{f^4}&nonsense=.png)

> <b>Note</b>: As in the case of the LTQ-FT data, The formula could only be verified with respect to B and C, because A was consistently set to 0 in all availbale data files.

It is interesting to observe that the second pair of coefficients, C and D, apparently works just as well:

> ![http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=M/z%20=%20\frac{C}{f^2}%20%2B%20\frac{D}{f^4}&nonsense=.png](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=M/z%20=%20\frac{C}{f^2}%20%2B%20\frac{D}{f^4}&nonsense=.png)

There was no significant difference between the two versions of the transform in a few randomly picked samples. It may be that B and C define the transform that takes into account the lock mass correction, while the transform defined by D and E does not, but this is just a conjecture at this point.

The meaning of 'I' is not certain. It is tempting to think of it as 'intercept', but that is, too, the function of 'A', if our guess is correct. It may be that A and I are the intercept co-ordinates in the two alternative transforms, but to know that for sure, samples with non-zero A and I must be examined.

## Example 3: LTQ Orbitrap, ITMS ##

In this example, the profile comes from the linear trap analyzer (which is typically used in the MS2 scans). I am not sure whether the analyzer is always calibrated in the M/z values, or the software at the receiving end was configured to do the transform just in this case, but the result is a transformed spectrum.

There is nothing but the profile in this scan data packet -- just the header and the profile. No peak calls.
