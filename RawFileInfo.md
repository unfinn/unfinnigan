This variable-size structure consists of RawFileInfoPreamble followed by six text strings. The first five strings contain the headings for the user-defined labels stored in SeqRow. The sixth string is probably used to store the name of the sample.

The older versions of RawFileInfoPreamble contained an unpacked rpresentation of the file creation date in the UTC time zone.

The modern versions of the preamble also contain the pointer to ScanData and the pointer to RunHeader, which in turn stores pointers to all other data streams in the file.

There are other data elements in the modern preamble, whose meaning is unkonwn.

## The unknowns ##

The last text tag appears to contain the sample name, but I have not received a confirmation yet, and the Thermo tools do not display it.

Other examples of `unknown text`:
