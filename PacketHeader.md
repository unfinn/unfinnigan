## Purpose ##

This is a substructure of ScanDataPacket, which stores the layout indicator and sizes of the data streams acquired during one scan or derived from it.


## Structure ##
### Static size: 40 bytes ###

| offset | size | type | key | example value | interpretation |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:----|:--------------|:---------------|
| 0      | 4    | UInt32 | `unknown long[1]` | `1`           |                |
| 4      | 4    | UInt32 | `profile size` | `5624`        | variable size  |
| 8      | 4    | UInt32 | `peak list size` | `1161`        | _2路n+1_        |
| 12     | 4    | UInt32 | `layout` | `128`         |                |
| 16     | 4    | UInt32 | `descriptor list size` | `580`         | _n_            |
| 20     | 4    | UInt32 | `size of unknown stream` | `581`         | _n + 1_        |
| 24     | 4    | UInt32 | `size of triplet stream` | `27`          | _9路3_          |
| 28     | 4    | UInt32 | `unknown long[2]` | `0`           |                |
| 32     | 4    | Float32 | `low mz` | `400`         |                |
| 36     | 4    | Float32 | `high mz` | `2000`        |                |

All stream sizes are measured in 4-byte units (they contain only floating-point numbers); _n_ is the number of called peaks in the peak list. Because each peak in the list contains both the centroid _M/z_ and the calculated signal intensity, the list has the total of _2路n_ numbers, plus one 4-byte integer containing the list length (580 路 2 + 1 = 1161).

        yield Float32(self, "high mz", "Scan high M/z; appears in filterLine in mzXML")
